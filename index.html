                Hello! I am an undergraduate student at 
                Simon Fraser University pursuing a Bachelor of Science
                degree in Computer Science, with a focus on Artificial 
                Intelligence. At SFU, I volunteer as an Undergraduate 
                Researcher in the <a href="https://sfumars.com/people/george-giovanis/"
                class="Link"> Multi-Agent Robotic Systems laboratory</a> 
                under professor <a href="https://sfumars.com/mo-chen/" 
                class="Link">Mo Chen</a>, where I work in the area of automated
                systems and machine learning.

                <br><br>

                I am also very interested in software development. I am currently
                in the midst of creating my own business, Incrementle Development,
                which will focus on creating custom productivity applications for 
                the App Store and Play Store. Our first project - SwiftCalc is 
                set to launch in the next few months.

                My research aims to enhance the efficiency of algorithms
                that run in exponential time through the use of new coding
                languages. I also work in the area of visual navigation, where 
                I oversee the execution of neural networks on robotics equipment.
                The abstract from my first paper citation can be seen below:

                a novel visual navigation framework that combines learning-based 
                and model-based approaches has been proposed. Specifically, a 
                Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) predicts a waypoint that is 
                used by the dynamics model for planning and tracking a 
                trajectory to the waypoint. However, the CNN inevitably makes 
                prediction errors, ultimately leading to collisions, especially 
                when the robot is navigating through cluttered and tight spaces. 
                In this paper, we present a novel Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) 
                reachability-based method to generate supervision for the CNN 
                for waypoint prediction. By modeling the prediction error of 
                the CNN as disturbances in dynamics, the proposed method 
                generates waypoints that are robust to these disturbances, and 
                consequently to the prediction errors. Moreover, using globally 
                optimal HJ reachability analysis leads to predicting waypoints 
                that are time-efficient and do not exhibit greedy behavior. 
                Through simulations and experiments on a hardware testbed, we 
                demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach for 
                navigation tasks where the robot needs to navigate through 
                cluttered, narrow indoor environments.

            <p>
                Since beginning my second degree in Computer Science, I have
                undergone a thorough introduction into software development. So
                far, I have completed one major project at SFU - a web-based
                multiplayer game built off of the NodeJS framework. Currently,
                I am co-developing my first iPhone and Android application - SwiftCalc,
                which is an efficient, minimalistic calculator that aims to
                provide the utility of a scientific/graphing calculator with 
                a profile no larger than that of the native calculator that 
                comes installed on a new phone.

                <h2>Current Work: SwiftCalc</h2>

                    <img src="pictures/swiftCalc.png" id="calc">
                    SwiftCalc is a calculator app that will offer the functionality
                    of a more powerful calculator with a minimalistic interface.
                    The app is built using Google's Flutter platform, which allows
                    for cross-platform development. 
                     
                    The calculator utilizes swipe gestures to allow users to access
                    multuple functions from a single button.

                S.F.U. is a web-based game built off of the NodeJS framework that
                is currently running on Heroku's web hosting platform. The game
                uses Socket.IO to enable multiple users to play in game lobbies.
                The goal of the game is to navigate through the halls of Simon
                Fraser University whilst destroying enemies (in the form of 
                bad grades). S.F.U. offers a unique and interactive gaming.
                <br><br>
                I co-developed S.F.U. and played a large role in the development
                of the game engine and web interface. I was also responsible for
                writing tests for the game using Mocha and Chai.
