                My research in the MARS lab aims to enhance the efficiency and 
                understandability of algorithms that run in exponential time 
                through the use of novel coding languages.
                
                I also work in the area of visual navigation, where 
                I oversee the execution of neural networks on robots.
                A link to my first paper citation is available below. For this 
                paper, I was responsible for executing the real-world hardware
                experiments, and writing the corresponding content 
                (Section 7, Figures 1 and 7) in the paper.

                In Bansal et al. (2019), 
                a novel visual navigation framework that combines learning-based 
                and model-based approaches has been proposed. Specifically, a 
                Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) predicts a waypoint that is 
                used by the dynamics model for planning and tracking a 
                trajectory to the waypoint. However, the CNN inevitably makes 
                prediction errors, ultimately leading to collisions, especially 
                when the robot is navigating through cluttered and tight spaces. 
                In this paper, we present a novel Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) 
                reachability-based method to generate supervision for the CNN 
                for waypoint prediction. By modeling the prediction error of 
                the CNN as disturbances in dynamics, the proposed method 
                generates waypoints that are robust to these disturbances, and 
                consequently to the prediction errors. Moreover, using globally 
                optimal HJ reachability analysis leads to predicting waypoints 
                that are time-efficient and do not exhibit greedy behavior. 
                Through simulations and experiments on a hardware testbed, we 
                demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach for 
                navigation tasks where the robot needs to navigate through 
                cluttered, narrow indoor environments.
